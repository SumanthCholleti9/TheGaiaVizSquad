# Gaiaviz Squad - DAEN 690 Capstone

## Topic
**UN Sustainable Development Goals High-Dimensional Data Explorer**

## Description
Since 2015, the United Nations has united governments, the private sector, and civil society around 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals provide a roadmap to address health, social, political, and economic issues for a better future.

In particular, Goal 17, "Partnerships for The Goals," emphasizes the need to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. This involves increased inclusion of the least developed countries in the trade system, as well as sharing resources, expertise, and technology to enhance their self-sufficiency (Goal 17 | Department of Economic and Social Affairs, n.d.).

The progress of SDGs is monitored through a complex and multidimensional dataset, comprising 2.7 million records in 2023, available in CSV and/or JSON formats. To effectively visualize this data beyond traditional 2D graphs, there is a need for a more advanced approach. This approach should provide a holistic view, allowing project participants to comprehend the intricate relations surrounding the goals.

## Goals
The Gaiaviz Squad aims to enhance the presentation of SDGs to facilitate decision-making at higher levels and promote actionability at the grassroots level. The focus is on improving communication of key insights within these complex systems. The goal is to empower stakeholders to understand how their contributions fit into the larger picture. This understanding enables effective communication with other key players and sharing of actionable information.
