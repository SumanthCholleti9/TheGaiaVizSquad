# Capstone Project: UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) High-Dimensional Data Explorer

## Overview
This capstone project, conducted as part of DAEN 690 course, focuses on enhancing the representation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals through innovative 3D visualizations. The project aims to facilitate deeper understanding and efficient decision-making regarding SDGs by transforming complex, multi-dimensional data into intuitive, interactive 3D graphics using GaiaViz software.

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: Utilize GaiaViz to create dynamic, interactive 3D representations of SDG data.
- **Data Integration**: Implement Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to prepare and integrate data for visualization.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Users can explore SDG progress across different regions and time periods interactively.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data preprocessing and analysis.
- GaiaViz software for 3D visualization.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
